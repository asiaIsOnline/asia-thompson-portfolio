        "testimonialText": <p>I had the chance to work with Asia for over a year, and I truly enjoyed the opportunity I got to collaborate with her.<br/><br/> She transformed an earlier version of our middle school coding courses by creating fun, beautiful web-based projects that students could learn to build. I have heard of how her delivery of the materials that she created engaged and inspired students, and I am not surprised by that considering the remarkable quality of the curricula she created. Whenever I had a request from her, she would respond quickly and immediately get me the deliverable.<br/><br/> There were several occasions when her insights and ideas helped me to improve the designs I produce in my work as well. I can confidently recommend Asia as I know that her excitement to learn and tackle challenges and her ability to connect with others are sure to contribute greatly to any future teams.</p>

She was someone who was always dependable, as well as going above and beyond on multiple occasions to get the job done.<br/><br/> Asia has personally been helpful in saving the company from financial losses by offering insight in areas she was not technically 'specialized' in.

Any team would be lucky to have her and Caroo would hire her back in a heartbeat if she wanted to return.</p>
