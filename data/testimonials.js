She transformed an earlier version of our middle school coding courses by creating fun, beautiful web-based projects that students could learn to build. I have heard of how her delivery of the materials that she created engaged and inspired students, and I am not surprised by that considering the remarkable quality of the curricula she created. Whenever I had a request from her, she would respond quickly and immediately get me the deliverable. There were several occasions when her insights and ideas helped me to improve the designs I produce in my work as well. I can confidently recommend Asia as I know that her excitement to learn and tackle challenges and her ability to connect with others are sure to contribute greatly to any future teams."
